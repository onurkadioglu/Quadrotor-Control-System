# Quadrotor-Control-System
In this repository, a cascade PID controller is designed for a quadrotor, to control the attitude and the position. This group project is an exam project for Aerospace Control Systems course of Politecnico di Milano in the 2021/2022 academic year. The base code of Robust_Attitude_Controller is derived from exercise session 4 of the same course by Giovaanni Gozzini. This readme file is also based on the same lecture.
