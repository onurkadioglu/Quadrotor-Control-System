# Quadrotor-Control-System
In this repository, a cascade PID controller is designed for a quadrotor, to control the attitude and the position. This group project is an exam project for Aerospace Control Systems course of Politecnico di Milano in the 2021/2022 academic year. The base code of Robust_Attitude_Controller is derived from exercise session 4 of the same course by Giovaanni Gozzini. This readme file is also based on the same lecture.
In this project, we are asked to design a control system for a quadrotor;

Designing a controller to control the attitude: “Attitude Control”
Designing a controller to control the position: “Position Control”

Also, “Robust Stability Analysis” will be carried out with two different methods considering the parametric uncertainty; 

Model Uncertainty Approach
Monte-Carlo Study


The system is discretized to be implementable on a quadrotor as a real-time system.
